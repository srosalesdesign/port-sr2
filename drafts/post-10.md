In Germany, Hesse saw an animated film called Aos by Yoji Kuri, and it had a significant influence on her.  Looking at her work, how do you think it influenced her?  Can you think of a work from another cultural form that influenced you in a similar way?   Here is a link to Aos : https://youtu.be/M3pAHkkn81E


How does Hesse describe her making of Ringarounda Arosie? Materially, experimentally?  What is Sol Lewitt’s advice with her struggles?


How did technology influence Hesse’s work?

What role did the process of making play in the final forms of her mature works?

What was the illness that caused Hesse to die?  Was it caused by her use of materials?
